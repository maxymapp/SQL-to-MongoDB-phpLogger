# ActivityLogger
This code bundle showcases one of the modules I worked on.
The code uses Doctrine Entity Listeners with PHP Symfony Framework to let us dispatch actions upon changes to programmer-defined DB entities representing client orders in MySQL database. The changes are written to MongoDB as documents and subsequently rendered with Vue.JS.
