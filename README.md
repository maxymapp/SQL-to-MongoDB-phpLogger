# ActivityLogger
This code bundle showcases one of the modules I worked on.
The code uses Doctrine Entity Listeners to let us dispatch actions upon changes to programmer-defined DB entities representing client orders. (https://symfony.com/doc/4.2/doctrine/event_listeners_subscribers.html)
The updates are recorded to MongoDB and rendered with Vue.JS.
DISCLAIMER: references to sensitive data have beem removed from the code for the code to demonstrate programming techniques only.
